# GiftSwap Telegram Bot

GiftSwap is a telegram bot used for gift exchanges amongst your group of friends.

Amidst the Covid-19 pandemic, we are unable to interact with our friend groups physically, hence GiftSwap is made to facilitate interactions with your friends
by carrying out gift exchanges! We believe that giving and receiving gifts can help to increase moral and strengthen bonds even in the Covid-19 pandemic.
